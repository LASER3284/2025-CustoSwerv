# Ayzee is writing some example Swerve Code #

This code is gonna be some custom swerve code based upon previous C++ versions
of 3284 swerve code. Historically, we've written entirely custom drive train
code, even for swerve, since it is (in my opinion) not all that difficult to get
something that works.

This also means that this code won't contain perfect optimizations. That's not
the point: the point is to demonstrate the minimum needed for viable custom
swerve, and making it *good* is an exercise left to the reader.
